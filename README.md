Airbnb is a company that offers a software platform dedicated to offering accommodation to individuals and tourists through which the hosts can advertise and contract the lease, The goal of AirBnb Clone Project is to learn how works, and how to build a complete dynamic web site, this project was developed in different stages:
  - The console
  - Web Static
  - MySQL
  - Deploy Static
  - Web Framework
  - RESTful API
  - Web Dynamic

## * The console
With the console you can:
  - Create you data model
  - Manage (Create, destroy, update, ...) objects via a command interpreter
  - Store and persis objects to a file (JSON file) 

#### Technologies 
* [Python](www.python.org) - Command line interpreter builded in Python3
* [JSON](www.json.org) - Is a lightweight data exchange format

## * Web Static
All simple web page need HTML, CSS and this is the goal of this stage:
 - Learn and apply HTML and CSS
 - create the HTML frontend of the application
 - Create a template of each object

### Technologies
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML) - Used to build of the web and content structure 
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS) - Style language to describe the HTML representation

## * MySQL
SQL us used to cominicate with a database, it is the standar language for relational database management system. with MySQL you can:
 - Replace the file storage by a Database storage
 - Map your models to a table in database by using an ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

### Technologies
* [MySQL](www.mysql.com) - Database management system.
* [SQLAlchemy](www.sqlalchemy.org) - Python SQL Toolkit and ORM that give us flexibility of SQL.

## * Deploy Static
When the structure involves more than one server, it tends to be difficult to synchronize the data, configuration, and every operation, for this reason, the deployment tool is necessary, helping to deploy in one execution overall servers through SSH protocol.

### Technologies
* [Fabric](www.fabfile.org) - Fabric is a python library and command-line for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or system administrator task.
* [Nginx](www.nginx.com) - Web server and proxy reverse, accelerates content and application delivery, improve security.
* [haproxy](www.haproxy.org) - Reliable, high performance TCP/HTTP load balancer.

## * Web Framework
